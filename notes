[1]   1. Delete package-lock.json (not package.json!) and/or yarn.lock in your project folder.
[1]   2. Delete node_modules in your project folder.
[1]   3. Remove "babel-eslint" from dependencies and/or devDependencies in the package.json file in your project folder.
[1]   4. Run npm install or yarn, depending on the package manager you use.
[1]
[1] In most cases, this should be enough to fix the problem.
[1] If this has not helped, there are a few other things you can try:
[1]
[1]   5. If you used npm, install yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/) and repeat the above steps with it instead.      
[1]      This may help because npm has known issues with package hoisting which may get resolved in future versions.
[1]
[1]   6. Check if C:\Users\markd\code\graph-app\node_modules\babel-eslint is outside your project directory.  
[1]      For example, you might have accidentally installed something in your home folder.
[1]
[1]   7. Try running npm ls babel-eslint in your project folder.
[1]      This will tell you which other package (apart from the expected react-scripts) installed babel-eslint.

[1] If nothing else helps, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.
[1] That would permanently disable this preflight check in case you want to proceed anyway.
